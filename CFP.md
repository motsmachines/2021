Workshop: 5 March 2021 

### About
Language, humans, machines… How are they interconnected? Are machines able to understand a natural language? To understand jokes and puns? Can machines translate them? What are their limits?

The questions of the place of machines in text understanding and translation is especially difficult in the case of humour, as the acceptance of a particular type of humour depends on sociological factors and varies from person to person. Humour contributes to higher subjective well being (both physical and psychological) and is often used to make light of difficult or stressful situations and to brighten up a social atmosphere in general. However, humour perception depends on the culture, thus comedies are not always successful when transplanted into another culture. Humour understanding often requires cultural references or/and catching double meaning, making the text difficult to translate or untranslatable at all.

The aim of this issue of the workshop is to provide a communication platform for translators, computer scientists, and linguists in order to tackle these questions.

Mots/Machines-2021 is the third issue of the workshop organised by the HCTI lab (Héritages et Constructions dans le Texte et l'Image).
